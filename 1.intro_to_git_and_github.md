# Introduction to git and github

## How to track changes to directories

#### The traditional way (without a version control software)

  * How do you know who created a particular version of a document (file created by times are not reliable because the time a file was first saved on the   current device is not necessarily the actual creation date)?
    - Use an appropriate naming convention with author intials in the name (rarely adhered to in large teams)
  * How do you know when a document version was created (file created by times  are not reliable because the person who saved the file on the current device   is not necessarily the original author)?
    - Use an appropriate naming convention with time and date in the name (rarely adhered to in large teams)
  * How do you revert to an earlier version of a document?
    - Keep a copy of the earlier version, and delete later versions (but then  you can't go back to the deleted versions).
  * How do you keep a track of changes
    - Use track changes feature if using MS office, or you can't
  * How do you prevent public read access to a document
    - Store it in a restricted drive
  * How do you prevent public write access to a document whilst allowing read   access
    - Password protect it (if using MS Office) or you can't
  * How do you require approval changes to the master version of a document
    - Password protect it (if Office document) and/or store it in a restricted   drive, which only certain people have access to.
  * How do you know who changed a document last (file modified dates are not  reliable)
    - Restrict write access to one person. That person is the person who amended it (unless that person person changes over time, in which case you're screwed.
  * How do you circulate a version of a document to a group of people?
    - Use email or slack or present changes at a meeting
  * How do you get feedback from a group of people?
    - Use email or slack or enable comments (if using MS Office) or review together in a meeting
  * How do you record who approved changes to a document and when?
    - A change log, manually maintained.
  * How do you handle multiple simultaneous updates to a file?
    - Last change overwrites earlier changes, with no way to pick and choose particular changes made by other people.


#### A better way

Alternatively, use a version control system like subversion, MS sharepoint, or ... git.


## What is git?

Git is version tracking system (aka a version control system), particularly well suited to collaborative working.

Git was created in 2005 by Linux developers (including the famous Linus Torvalds) to manage collaborative development of Linux.


## What is git used for?

Git is most commonly used to track software projects, but it can be used to track changes to almost any text based documents (or collection of such documents). For example, the drafting and redrafting of books has been helped by using git.


## What is a git repository?

"Git repository" is a term used to refer to a directory (aka folders) you've asked git to track. (Technically the git repository is a hidden sub-folder within the directory, which git uses to track the changes to that directory, but in everyday usage this distinction is unimportant.)

Tracking directories does not alter the way you use them.

Git repositories (aka tracked directories) are also sometimes called "repos": short for repositories.

With git you can:
  * save a version of the directory (without cluttering the directory up with lots of extra files)
  * view the history of changes to files and directories
    - who made exactly what changes
    - when changes were made
  * revert changes you don't want



## Do I need to use terminal commands to use git?

No, just use GitHub and GitHub Desktop, which are user friendly intefaces to git, the underlying system.

There are numerous advanced things you can only do from the command line in a terminal window, but these are rarely needed by non-developers.



## What is GitHub?

GitHub is a a website for publishing/sharing git repositories.

GitHub also provides it's own workflow for collaborating on changes to repositories: i.e. reviewing and approving changes. This was one of the unique selling point that has made github so popular.

Through GitHub, teams of people can
 * Upload/download copies of directories to share them with others and to use as a backup directory.
 * View/navigate directories and files you have access to in a similar way to how you view and navigate files and directories on your local computer
 * View the history of changes to files and directories
    - who made exactly what changes
    - when changes were made
    - who commented on the changes, when they commented, and what they said
    - who approved the changes and when
 * Submit a change proposal
    - showing line by line what changes are being proposed
    - proposals can have a description of and justification for the changes
 * Review proposed changes
    - see exactly what changes are being proposed
    - see the stated reasons for the changes
    - comment on changes (including commenting line by line)
    - reply to other comments
 * Formally accept or decline proposed changes
 * Apply various restrictions on access to directories (paid accounts only)

(GitHub even allows you to change text files on its site, but only if you want: you don't have to do this).
