# General How Tos

**This file outlines general how tos that are not necessarily part of the GitHub workflow.**



## How to the see the history of changes

Every time a new version of the directory is stored, git records something called a "commit". Each commit is a record of the changes (i.e. changes to the files) that were associated with the creation of a new version of the directory. You can view the changes associated with each version by examining the history (aka the commit history).


#### Step 1: Select a label name (aka branch)

The git term for a label is "branch"
Changes you store (aka commit) are associated with a label you set up. (Even if you forget to associate them with a label your changes still get labelled with the "master" label).

Select the label (aka branch) you're interested in from the drop down at the top of the screen.


#### Step 2: View the history

On the repository screen on Github, select the commits tab.


#### Step 3: View changes for a commit

Click a commit to see the set of changes included in that commit.

The exact changes included in the selected commit will appear on the right of the screen. Lines that have been removed show in red and lines that have been added show in green.
