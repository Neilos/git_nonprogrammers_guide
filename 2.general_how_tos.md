## How to the see the history of changes

Every time a new version of the directory is stored, git records something called a "commit". Each commit is a record of the changes (i.e. changes to the files) that were associated with the creation of a new version of the directory. You can view the changes associated with each version by examining the history (aka the commit history).


#### Step 1: Select a label name (aka branch)

Remember that the git term for a label is "branch"
Remember that changes you store (aka commit) are associated with a label you set up. (Even if you forget to associate them with a label your changes still get labelled with the "master" label).
Remember also that git's name for labels is "branch".

Select the label (aka branch) you're interested in from the drop down at the top of the screen.


#### Step 2: View the history

Select "History" from the "View" menu.

When you first select history, only the most recent change associated with the selected label (aka branch) is shown.

Click the button "View Branch" to see all the earlier changes.

On the left of the screen are the list of commits associated with the selected label (aka branch); newest changes appear at the top.


#### Step 3: View changes for a commit

Click a commit to see the set of changes included in that commit.

The exact changes included in the selected commit will appear on the right of the screen. Lines that have been removed show in red and lines that have been added show in green.
