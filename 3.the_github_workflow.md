# The GitHub Workflow

This file outlines the github workflow, which at a high level is as follows:

1. Open the repository on Github
2. Create a change label (aka create a branch)
3. Make the changes you want
4. Create change proposal (aka create a pull request)
5. Review change proposal
6. Approve or reject a change proposal


*****

## Open the repository on Github

On Github, go to your profile.
Select the repositories tab to find repositories you are the owner of, or select an organization you belong to (under your picture), and select the repositories tab to find repositories that organisation owns.

Click on a repository name to get to the repository screen.


*****

## Create a change label (aka create a branch)

The first thing you should do, before you start making changes, is create a label for your changes.

As you store your directory changes you will associate them with this label, and then later that label will be applied to the change proposal that you submit for approval by your colleagues.

In git, the proper term for a label like this is a "branch".

On Github, open the repository page.

The "master" label/branch always points to the current master version of the directory. The current master version of the directory contains all the the approved changes to date.

Make sure you start on the master version by selecting "Branch: master" from the select box in the top right of the screen.

Then click the selection box again and enter a meaningful name that briefly encapsulates what your changes will be about.

If you want to add a change to an existing label (aka branch) select it, otherwise, click "Create branch: [whatever]" to create a new label (aka branch)



*****

## Make the changes you want

The git term for storing a set of changes is "committing the changes". At the same time git stores the changes, a new version of the directory is also stored.


#### Step 1: Create or change files as required

Use the "New File" button to create new files, or use the "Find File" button to find a file to edit and then edit by clicking the pencil icon ("edit" button).


#### Step 2: Store changes (aka commit changes)

When you are happy with your changes fill in the form at the bottom of the page to store (aka commit) your changes.

  1. Enter a short description of the changes in the 1st field. It is best practice to use the *present imperative tense* (e.g. "add such and such", "Make it clear that this is that", "Remove unnecessary lines about such and such")
  2. Enter a longer description in the "description" field. It is best practice to outline the actual reasons for these changes here.
  3. Click the button "Commit to [branch name]".

The changes you've made are now stored (aka committed) in a record called a "commit" and that commit is associated with the label you created (or selected earlier).

Keep adding more commits to store more changes as required.


*****

## Create change proposal (aka create a pull request)

When you have made all the changes you want GitHub lets you submit a change proposal for your fellow collaborators to review and either accept or reject.

The github term for a change proposal is a "pull request".


#### Step 1: Start new pull request

Open the repository on github.
Click the button "New pull request" button.


#### Step 2: Select the label (aka branch)

At the top of the screen in the "compare: master" select box select your label.


#### Step 3: Review the changes

Scroll down to review the changes: line by line or commit by commit. If you're happy continue.


#### Step 4: Write a description

Write a description of the changes, including any reasons why you think the changes are necessary.


#### Step 5: Create pull request

Click the button "Create pull request"


*****

## Review change proposal (aka Review the pull request)

On GitHub, click the pull requests tab and click the pull request you want to use

See acomments (only still relevant comments) from people on the comments tab.

Review the changes, one commit at a time on the commits tab, or review the changes file by file and line by line on the Files Changes tab.


#### How to leave inline comments

On GitHub, on the pull request screen, when reviewing the changes file by file and line by line on the "Files Changed" tab, hover over a line and click the plus(+) sign to add an inline comment about that part of the changes.


#### How to leave a general comment on all the changes

On GitHub, on the pull request screen, on the conversation tab fill in the add comment form to add a general comment (e.g. "Looks good to me", "Rubbish. Don't talk to me ever again")


#### How to make amendments to the change proposal (aka pull request)

The change proposal (aka pull request) is entirely amendable. Just make more commits against the label (aka branch) and publish them and the new changes will show up against the pull request.

GitHub is even clever enough to hide comments that are made obsolete by subsequently published changes.


*****

## Approve or reject a change proposal (aka pull request)

When you're sure everyone has finished commenting and adjusting the amendments accordingly you can choose to accept the change or reject it.


#### How to accept

The GitHub term for accepting a change proposal and incorporating the changes into the master version of the directory is "merging the branch to master".

On GitHub, on the pull request screen, on the conversation tab click the "Merge pull request" button


#### How to reject

You can reject a change proposal by closing the pull request

On GitHub, on the pull request screen, on the conversation tab, click the
"Close pull request" button to reject the changes.
