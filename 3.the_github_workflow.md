# The GitHub Workflow


*****

## Create a change label (aka a branch)

The first thing you should do, before you even commit to any changes, is create a label for your changes.

As you store your directory changes you will associate them with this label, and then later that label will be applied to the change proposal that you submit for approval by your colleagues.

In git, the proper term for a label like this is a "branch".


#### Step 1: Naming your new label (aka branch)

Select "New Branch" from the "File" menu

Enter a meaningful name that briefly encapsulates what your changes will be about.


#### Step 2: Make sure you're starting "from" master

The "master" label/branch always points to the current master version of the directory. The current master version of the directory contains all the the approved changes to date.

Make sure the "from" field says "master". This tells git that you are intending your changes to be applied to the master version of the directory (and not some other random version).


#### Step 3: Finish creating the label (aka branch)

Click the "Create Branch" button

Now you've created your label for the set of changes you are intending, the changes you make and any new directory versions created as a result of those changes will automatically be associated with that label/branch. This will be useful later when you come to submit your changes for approval.


#### Step 4: Publish you label

Click the "Publish" button in the top right corner of the screen.

## Make the changes you want


#### Step 1: Sync with GitHub

Make sure that you're up-to-date with everyone else's changes, by syncing with github. The git term for syncing is "fetching". (Sync regularly to avoid problems that can only be fixed on the command line.)

Click the Sync button.


#### Step 2: Select your label

Always remember that changes you store in git must always be associated with a label (aka a branch).

In the drop down at the top of the screen, select the label (aka branch) to which you want to associate your changes. It is important that you select the correct label: i.e. the one that corresponds to the directory version you want to make amendments to. If you've just created a label: that one.


#### Step 3: Get other people's changes

If other people have made any changes using the same label as you're using (aka on the same branch) you should combine their changes with your work by "pulling" in changes.

The select "Pull" from "Repository" menu.


#### Step 4: Change files as required

Change any files as you would normally, and save them as you would normally.


*****

## Store changes (aka make a commit) and a new version of the directory


#### Step 1: Review this current set of changes

Select "Uncommitted changes" from the "View" menu.

On the left of the screen are a list of files that have been changed.
Select a file, and then, on the right of the screen, are the details of the changes to that file. Lines that have been removed are shown in red and lines that have been added are shown in green.

Make sure you're happy with all the changes before carrying on.


#### Step 2: Store changes (aka make a commit)

The git term for storing a set of changes is "committing the changes". At the same time git stores the changes, a new version of the directory is also stored.

Fill in the form at the bottom left of the page to store (aka commit) your changes.

  1. Enter a short description of the changes in the "Summary" field. It is best practice to use the *present imperative tense* (e.g. "add such and such", "Make it clear that this is that", "Remove unnecessary lines about such and such")
  2. Enter a longer description in the "description" field. It is best practice to outline the actual reasons for these changes here.
  3. Click the button "Commit to [branch name]".

The changes you've made are now stored (aka committed), and git has also stored a new version of the directory, which you can return to at a later date if you want.


*****

## Publish and backup your changes to github

The git term for publishing your changes is "pushing".

Make sure you the right lable (aka branch) is selected.
Then click the "publish" button in the top left of the screen.


*****

## Open the repository on GitHub

Select "View on GitHub" from the "Repository"
The repository will open on github in your browser.


*****

## Create a change proposal (aka a pull request)

GitHub allows you to propose changes so that others in your team can review, comment, and either accept or reject.

The github term for a change proposal is a "pull request".


#### Step 1: Start new pull request

On GitHub click the button "New pull request"


#### Step 2: Select the label (aka branch)

At the top of the screen in the "compare: master" select box select your label.


#### Step 3: Review the changes

Scroll down to review the changes: line by line or commit by commit. If you're happy continue.


#### Step 4: Write a description

Write a description of the changes, including any reasons why you think the changes are necessary.


#### Step 5: Create pull request

Click the button "Create pull request"


*****

## Review change proposal (aka pull request)

On GitHub, click the pull requests tab and click the pull request you want to use

See acomments (only still relevant comments) from people on the comments tab.

Review the changes, one commit at a time on the commits tab, or review the changes file by file and line by line on the Files Changes tab.


#### How to leave inline comments

On GitHub, on the pull request screen, when reviewing the changes file by file and line by line on the "Files Changed" tab, hover over a line and click the plus(+) sign to add an inline comment about that part of the changes.


#### How to leave a general comment on all the changes

On GitHub, on the pull request screen, on the conversation tab fill in the add comment form to add a general comment (e.g. "Looks good to me", "Rubbish. Don't talk to me ever again")


#### How to make amendments to the change proposal (aka pull request)

The change proposal (aka pull request) is entirely amendable. Just make more commits against the label (aka branch) and publish them and the new changes will show up against the pull request.

GitHub is even clever enough to hide comments that are made obsolete by subsequently published changes.


*****

## Approve or reject a change proposal (aka pull request)

When you're sure everyone has finished commenting and adjusting the amendments accordingly you can choose to accept the change or reject it.


#### How to accept

The GitHub term for accepting a change proposal and incorporating the changes into the master version of the directory is "merging the branch to master".

On GitHub, on the pull request screen, on the conversation tab click the "Merge pull request" button


#### How to reject

You can reject a change proposal by closing the pull request

On GitHub, on the pull request screen, on the conversation tab, click the
"Close pull request" button to reject the changes.
